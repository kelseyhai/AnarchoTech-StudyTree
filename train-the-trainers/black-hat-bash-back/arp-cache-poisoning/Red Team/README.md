# Performing an ARP Cache Poisoning attack

In this exercise we will pretend to be a machine on the LAN that we are not by lying about the IP address we were given by the LAN's DHCP server. This will enable us to arbitrarily redirect local network traffic to any machine we wish, including ourselves, such that we can perform network-based Denial-of-Service (DOS) or Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. We will accomplish this by exploiting the lack of peer authentication in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which maps an ethernet device's MAC address to its IP address.

Essentially, we will be performing an *ARP spoofing* attack. As this behavior is relatively conspicuous, we will also cover the basics of *MAC address spoofing*, which will assign a fake hardware address to the NIC you will use to emit spoofed ARP replies to the network. This combination of MAC and ARP spoofing enables you to masquerade as any other device on the local network segment.

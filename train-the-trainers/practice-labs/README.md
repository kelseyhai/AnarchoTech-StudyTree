# Practice Labs

In this folder, you'll find stand-alone workshop materials that focus on gaining hands-on experience with foundational and practical skills. All exercise material added here should be written in a manner that makes it accessible to beginners, even if you feel that the topic of the exercise is "advanced." If you cannot write the exercise so it is accessible to a beginner, you probably do not understand it well enough yourself.

This project is organized in the following way:

* `lab-name` folder, containing:
    * `README.md` file, containing a detailed walkthrough of the practice lab. Each lab or workshop should be chunked into sections and these sections should further conform to a conventional structure, described below. We recommend that, at a minimum, the `Objectives`, `Prerequisites`, `Set up`, and `Practice` sections be included in every lab, but you are free to write practice labs in whatever format you wish. You are encouraged to include all of the following standard sections:
        1. `Objectives` - a short list of achievable goals, no more than three or four. (If you are trying to accomplish more than four goals in one exercise, consider the possibility that you would be better off creating two separate exercises.)
        1. `Bill of materials` - a brief overview of the files and folders contained within the lab folder, with short descriptions of each, used to help assure the learner that they have the complete set of materials provided by the lab's author.
        1. `Prerequisites` - a (reasonably) thorough accounting of all the required materials or capabilities assumed to be available to the learner. Consider linking to other practice labs that you feel the learner should attempt before attempting this one.
        1. `Set up` - a (reasonably) exhaustive, step-by-step walkthrough for the exact steps needed to prepare for the practice lab. This typically includes installing the required software or (pre-)configuring a given infrastructural service.
        1. `Practice` - a detailed guide, written as prose, optimized for positive educational impact and geared to accomplish the goals of the lesson. Omit steps that are intended to be "an exercise for the reader," for obvious reasons.
        1. `Discussion` - supplemental information chunked into logical sections describing additional details related to the exercise or its practice.
        1. `Additional references` - a curated list of named links (not merely raw URLs) that further elucidate the topic, goals, or general subject matter but that are only relevant to particularly interested readers. Avoid including links to references already linked to in prior sections.

Before adding practice labs to this section, have a look through the other [Train the Trainers subprojects](../) to see if a similar workshop has already been created. If so, please improve that exercise/lab/workshop rather than spending (wasting?) your time duplicating our prior work. :)
